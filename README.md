# MovieScraper
A program which scrapes the IMDB Top Rated Movies list and outputs the list of movies in chronological order of release.

This is a project written in C# with Visual Studio. Html Agility pack is used as the underlying engine of web-scraping.

I wanted to watch all of the top rated movies, but thought that some of them could not be fully appreciated if watched in the order of the list. The idea is that when watched in cronological order of release, one can appreciate cinematic techniques as they develop, or clich√©s as they are invented. That way you don't go from Bravehart to Citizen Kane and consider it a comedown.
